# cooking.ai
This repo is dedicated to the creation of a diner dash like game where the character is controlled by a trained ai. This game will be made in Unity and use the ml-agents add-on. It will be a 3D game where the movement is restricted to a single plane.
## How the AI learns
We will be using reinforcment learning where the speed and corectness of the customers order is the reward that the AI will get. We will be adding food objects to the AI's order array, it will then use that and the inputs from a ray perception to see the kitchen objects and make the food.
